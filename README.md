## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

__This is my second Frontend Mentor Challenge!__  

I started this challenge with all the HTML and CSS first. I learned to use the CSS `pre-line` property and practiced `line-height` with the main text. I had some trouble positioning everything at first, but then I figured it out. I also learned how to put a color filter on a background image.  

After styling everything I started with the JS part. I'm not gonna lie, I struggled a lot and had to google many things, many times. I learned validation methods and properties and got to practice my DOM manipulation skills. I created a function that validated all inputs when the Submit button was clicked or when the input itself was changed. At the beggining it was very hard, but at the end I managed to solve all the problems I had, and learned a lot in the way. I'm happy with my JS code, though I think there's a way to make it cleaner (any help would be appreciated).  

When the desktop version (1440px) was finished, it was time for **Media Queries**. If the JS was difficult, the Media Queries were a complete headache. I spent hours fixing display problems and changing design properties to make it fit most resolutions. I think it could have been done better, but I am new to this, and this is the best I could do for now (will try to improve it in the future).  

I really liked this challenge cuz it was really ***challenging***. It helped me to learn lots of new things and to discover some weaknesses I have, as well as some abilities I could improve. It was a little stressful at times, but everytime I figured how to do something it felt amazing :)  

### Continued development

I want to keep using and practicing responsive design and Media Queries, because that was the thing I struggled the most.  
I also want to expand my Flexbox and Grid knowledge and learn some design theory and UI/UX.  
Backend coming soon too.
